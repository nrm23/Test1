I am a 4th year IT Game Design major taking this class as a free elective.  Even though that is my major, I am more interested in networking and security.  I have been taking specific computer classes since I was a freshman in highschool, but I realized I have yet to take a web design class.  I believe it is an important skill to have some knowledge in when working in the computer industry, so I decided to sign up for this class.
